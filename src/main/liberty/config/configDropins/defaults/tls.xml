      To enable TLS, in addition to the transportSecurity-1.0 feature,
      either specify keystore_password in server.env or as an
      environment variable, or specify a keystore element with an explicit
      password (optionally encrypted):
      https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/transportSecurity.html

      We choose the latter route so that we can pick up the password from non-envar
      sources which makes it easy to run without needing to git commit a password in server.env.
